# Mastermind in TDD #

Welcome to the Mastermind java console mini-game. 

### Concerning the functionnalities : ###

- You can choose the number of turn you want to play 
- You can enter your color emplacement guess for every turn
- It displays success or game over

### Improvement to add to the game: ###

- Manage erros in user input -> for example, if the user enter letters instead of numbers, it will break the game.
- Create a random combination to find at the start of every game -> today, it's a static combination 
- Add the possibility tor the user to choose the number of color to guess -> today, it's a static three colors combination
- Refactoring the game() function -> At first, it was not a part of the exercice but it allowed the user to play the game from the java console and add more interactivity to the game. 
- Display the combination history played at previous turns.
